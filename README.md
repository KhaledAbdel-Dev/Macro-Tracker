Created a full-stack web app to help users track calories and key macro-nutrients. Every user can securely sign up/in. Users can update their daily intake, add meals and snacks throughout the day and delete the board.

This application has all the classic CRUD elements typically found in full-stack applications.


This was created using HTML, CSS, Node.js and some vanilla JavaScript. Express.js was utilized as a template handler with a MongoDB database.
This is commonly referred to as the MERN stack.
